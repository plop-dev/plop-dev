HiðŸ‘‹, I'm maxime
I make websites, and that's pretty much it :)

I'm a self-taught developer (proudly a course and bootcamp free developer), but I've been learning a lot since I started. I'm currently learning React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS. Making production-quality websites is a priority for me, like thinking about accessibility and responsiveness as well as performance across devices/browsers.

I'm working on a 3d printing website, much more to come:
