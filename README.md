HiðŸ‘‹,  I'm plop
I make websites, and that's pretty much it :)

I'm a self-taught developer (proudly a course and bootcamp free developer), but I've been learning a lot since I started. I'm currently learning React, NextJS (soon), and TailwindCSS. Making production-quality websites is a priority for me, like thinking about accessibility and responsiveness as well as performance across devices/browsers.

I've recently been working on an RC plane, went with a 1.6m wing span (bit amibitious). Its flying is quite questionable but at least if flies :D.

I'm working on my portfolio website, much more to come:
